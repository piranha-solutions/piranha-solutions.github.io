        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I guess this notebook is now a memorial, isn’t it? I miss Maya so, so much; reading her entries made it even worse, I regret my choice of career, I should have been there for her at all times, but instead I was deployed during the very war that torn down my family. 
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believed it would only get better, but I couldn’t have been further from the truth; by trying to protect her I left her alone in a nation destroyed by conflicts. 
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today is the day I got into the big league, Astral Infantry, one of the only branches with access beyond our earths atmosphere; my platoon’s leader believes we were chosen by god himself to rule the skies of this delicate planet. You wouldn’t believe if I had to tell you how quickly we can get deployed all around the world, it’s terrifying! 
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will miss the simpler times when my biggest problem was passing high school, I feel like ever since the Americas united our education got a lot better, Maya was a genius for her age; I couldn’t say the same for myself even if I was the most selfish student out there. 
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will write more very soon, I’ve overheard our platoon leader mentioning that Chimera is being sent to Syria; we will guard the local Lorenzite depot, if it falls into wrong hands The Whole World may sink into self-destruction, and unlike Einstein’s sticks and stones quote, this time there will be no man to fight in the 4th World War. 
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hitchhiker signing out, long live our UEA.
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Writing this when Chimera is en route to Syria, I just hope we won’t need to use our weapons; every single target down is a family destroyed by a selfish terrorist, yet they all believe we are the bad of this world!</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They can’t just get away with everything they’ve done against humanity; threatening to use Lorenzite weaponry, while I don’t even know if Lorenzite is an element or a chemical compound! Hell, not even the scientists know what it is, all we know is it’s extremely powerful, and useful yet chaotic.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And while it is hard to control I bet every single atom of my body that my daughter would’ve already cracked the code! It was years ago but I still see her face, I can feel her judging every step I take without her as my guide; sometimes I just know what she would have wanted, and I hope this operation is one of those things.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alright, to be continued soon; our transport ship has landed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think I’ve found a nice little place to sit and write in while Sergeant Miller deals with the important stuff, not like I’m lazy it’s just that we’ve been transported over 6 thousand miles in less than 6 hours just so our leader can do work for us and later call us parasites!</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe I’m overreacting but I don’t think he should do that, considering he’s the same person that had to get Private Moore to make him a goddamn sandwich; I find it crazy how dependent he is on others yet he somehow still has the time to insult us.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m curious what he’s truly doing down there, the man he’s talking with looks dangerously sick; there’s blood draining from his ear. For some reason our squad leader is getting really nervous, his hands are shaking; this weather got both of them, I should tell TOC to call in medical support for they look pale like a wall in the barracks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The man has fell, good that I still have my radio; calling in to TOC, they need to know we’re gonna be low on EpiPens. Miller is okay for now, his hands stopped shaking after he did breathing exercises; I’m worried about the other guy, his ears open up a red stream of blood contrasting his pale skin, Lance Corporal Harris is administering an EpiPen, he’s going through extreme shock.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever he saw had to be… I forgot the word, I’m feeling weak; “TOC to Chimera, get away from the Lorenzite and administer epinephrine if negative effects persist, additional units have been sent” - they’re sending in support.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hitchhiker signing back in at 1500 hours, the sun is blinding, almost everyone got better now but TOC has gone dark and no sign of additional units on the horizon; we’re doing great as of now, the only exception is the man. The poor guy is vomiting and his eyes have gotten shell shock, Viper’s saying that he’s gonna be alright and I can only hope, he seemed pretty healthy for a younger soldier.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Miller is saying that all radio communications with central are down and we’re gonna have to get creative if we want to update them on the situation; he told us the Lorenzite depot is safe, but we have to get through a pretty civilized area and this was supposed to be a quick in n’ out operation to settle some formalities.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now it’s 1600 hours and we still aren’t on our communications center, halfway through TOC tried contacting us but all we heard was a bunch o’ noise and some vowels here and there; if our maps are to scale we are getting closer each step, Miller hasn’t changed at all after all these years for he’s still complaining about his goddamn boots like we aren’t issued the same pair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We’re finally there, the gates to paradise; now all we have to do is wait for them to open the giant garage door so we can comfortably ride in. I don’t wanna be rude but the people inside don’t sound American at all, can’t even pronounce our “Th” correctly; it’s probably gonna take longer to contact TOC with those guys in charge than it is to fly back to central in person. Alright, we’re inside but- the personnel doesn’t sound too happy to holster their 9x19mm “safety gear”; holy shit I’m not in the mood to swear but they have a fucking sound cannon strapped down with the barrel pointing into our stupid faces.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We’re dead, they’re taking Viper and I won’t let them kill the youngest pacifist of the west. They’ve closed us in a room without weapons, the only thing that could kill a human that I have are the knives in the very shoes that Miller wanted to throw out on the way here.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m asking their asses to let me piss and they’re laughing, I’m gonna make sure that I’m not gonna be close enough to the central for them to hear whatever is falling onto the ground besides blood and piss.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Guess who’s laughing now, me or the terrorist scum with his underwear stuffed in his mouth to muffle whatever he tries to spell out in English? All tied up, opening his bag and- oh Lord that’s a hell of a weapon for somebody that probably doesn’t know how to tie his own shoes! My favorite finding this year, a well furnished black and white Colt 2011, this beauty cannot be wasted.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m taking his ass to the back of the building so they don’t see the man that was supposed to watch me piss tied up alone in the dirt; Hitchhiker infiltrating through a backdoor with a terrorist on the other end of my newly acquired 2011, time to shine.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “Get down or his head-” I couldn’t finish my sentence for they’ve been already killed; I couldn’t believe my eyes, my squad was still locked in the very room they were in before, I needed to find out what happened. I’ve knocked the life out of the tied-up one and left him there to wake up, he was too young to die even as the man that would’ve killed me if he had the occasion to; I went searching the communications center to locate Viper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Viper’s in one of the rooms with a horrible attempt at scarification and they drugged him; he has a fucking thermal blade in his arms slowly losing strength to even hold it, he killed them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m currently rushing to the room to free the rest of my squad, Miller’s gonna take care of the communications, that was one hell of an ambush but I don’t care if I get hurt as long as Viper survives. “Chimera to TOC, do you copy?” luckily we’ve gotten a positive response, they’ve received the message to postpone the call for support; they know what happened to Viper and have told us to go back to the Lorenzite depot to wait for support, this time there won’t be a chance to back out.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 1800 hours we’re on the designated exfiltration point, another squad is taking the guard for we were there only as messengers; current state of Viper is unknown but son, I swear you can make it! Miller is all fine now, still as stubborn as a mule but trust me when I say, that man deserves to have a moment of peace for all that he went through in his life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hitchhiker en route to my homeland, signing out; Long live our UEA.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It has been half a month since the incident in Syria; we are back at our base in Georgia.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though we can’t really hear him from the Military Hospital, we all know Miller’s screaming at the medical personnel because they don’t allow him to meet Viper, they probably don’t want him to be reminded of his trauma, especially since Viper already has to report the events to Clark; our platoon leader wouldn’t consider that a young soldier that just went through shell shock doesn’t want to remember anything about “The Incident”.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Time will show how Syria may have changed Flores, I just want him to be safe for he has a lot to lose and a father he’s scared to disappoint.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Miller should be back soon, he’s as stubborn as ever but I don’t think it’s a good idea to depart from the base that much considering it’s 3 AM; not like he would’ve listened to me anyways, he wants to know the story he was part of.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It’s 0330 hours and he has just called us to come to the hospital, I’m not too sure what’s the reason to call us now but I’m not the kind of person to disobey my squad leaders order; Chimera’s getting ready for the visit, he was surprisingly joyful in the call so we’re all looking forward to whatever the good news is.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Writing this when we’re in front of the hospital doors, I can hear Miller speaking to somebody in the halls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides being told we’ve been expected all we had to do was find Miller, it’s almost like that was supposed to be hard with his assertive voice; Miller is speaking to somebody about us being here, I only hear him but at least we know where he is now.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh boy was the visit worth it, it’s Viper, he was speaking to Viper; he is doing reasonably well for the state he was found in before. He doesn’t seem shook at all, but now it may sound a bit crazy but he does look like he wouldn’t have a chance to survive if I didn’t go out to “take a piss” and probably save his life in the process.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You wouldn’t believe how surprised I am, for his answer to me asking why isn’t he stressed out at all was the dose of beta-blockers he received to lower his blood pressure; the sheer amount of carvedilol he took has effectively stopped his memories from Syria from coming back for some time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is just one problem with that, Miller has told me that if he doesn’t take carvedilol every once in a while he will get shell shock over and over again until his brain doesn’t have the memory or the beta-blockers are administered; which means that he is essentially addicted to carvedilol, and besides that, refusing to take it doesn’t only cause shell shock, but in longer duration can lead to panic attacks or severe heart problems. Well for now his backpack will have to be full of that at all times unless he wants to put everything on the line.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sadly we won’t hear anything from Viper so we have to resort to the camera footage collected by the support sent last minute by TOC, but I guess anything will do as long as he doesn’t need to remind himself of what he did; Miller is in the process of obtaining the footage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a radio broadcast calling all of Chimera to the base intel room, it’s Miller, he got the footage; let’s check it out to see what Viper has to say about being a pacifist now. Miller’s welcoming us inside with the remote waiting for us to stop discussing, and finally when the moment comes he plays the footage on a screen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It’s terrifying, first I see Viper getting taken by them to whatever is left from a well-furnished lunch room; they’re tying him up to a chair, chocking him, beating him, I can’t watch that anymore but I need to know what happened there. Then while he was being pumped with various drugs through an IV, one of the men takes out a knife, heats it up with a damn thermal blade and starts messily cutting into his skin; then in the matter of seconds Flores magically gets his hands out of a badly tied up rope, takes and stabs the sociopath that scarred him for life with his own knife, while the man was falling down on his knees trying to catch a breath, Viper was covering himself with a table he used as a shield until he found the opportunity to take the thermal blade and get out of the room while slicing an arm clean off of the last man trapped inside with him, taking his gun and firing a mercy shot, he got through the door and starts swinging at a pack of armed individuals but with every swing he gets weaker and weaker, he uses the sword to impale one of the men through the sternum but he gets shot multiple times in the process.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though his chances of survival were slim, he manages to avoid most of the lethal shots and fires a 9mm into the head of the last man standing; he tried opening the door to try and free Chimera, but he was too weak to do so and hid away in the very room it started in to save himself, as a medic he used clothes as makeshift bandages and tourniquets.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the very last moment of the footage before the rest of Chimera has been released, I came in with a hostage, not prepared to the sight of a bloodbath that occurred minutes ago.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am terrified to see that the youngest and least dangerous man in Chimera is able to fight off seven different people while under the influence of pharmacological torture, but that means that the man I’ve sworn to protect with my life is able to protect himself; luckily for him there is only one wound that hurt his vital organs, and even that wound isn’t that bad, most of his wounds should heal in less than 3 months but the one that hit his leg will require him to stay in one spot during operations after those 3 months pass for at least the next year.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Miller was staring at the screen even after the footage ended, I woke him up and we were finally allowed to head to the comfort of the barracks; on the way Miller gave me a duffel bag and asked me to bring it to Viper’s bunk for him to get it once he returns by the end of the month, I did so, but out of curiosity I wanted to check what was inside the bag.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was a sheathed blade, a thermal blade with the very same marks the man he was scarrificated by has had on his jacket.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hitchhiker signing out, long live our UEA and may Flores get back to health.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It’s Hitchhiker, almost 5 years have gone since Maya passed, the only person who went through as much as I have out in the Bering Strait is Miller; he’s the only person who knows what happened to Maya back there. The Incident in Syria reminded me of how fragile we truly are; all of us broken, yet standing, because we swore to protect the helpless and vulnerable people of both of the Americas.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We live in barracks so families won’t be broken, so children don’t lose their fathers and the mothers don’t lose their children; we are the first line of defense, the expendable force that stops others from whistling in as a sign for attack to leave others resembling whistles of the Aztec death whistles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Writing this when Chimera is en route to Syria, I just hope we won’t need to use our weapons; every single target down is a family destroyed by a selfish terrorist, yet no one knows if they deserved the life they got.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Viper can’t run without necessary support, even if he could I doubt he could run with the backpack full of carvedilol and two IFAK’s; for now he has to depend on us, if somebody gets close enough to chug a grenade or fire without getting shot by the squad I kind of doubt there is any of the squad left alive.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every visit here is a sweet little memory being overshadowed by the past.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chimera is landing, this time the depot is kept by another group, we’re here to take care of the riots caused by the communications center massacre last month; there is a lot of important people here and we can’t risk them getting hurt because we got attacked by terrorists.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As we land we’re being welcomed in by some familiar faces, diplomats from America; they say the terrorists call themselves the Myriad Network and have members from all around the world; the Myriad Network now seek control and loyalty of the middle-eastern region because of the instability of governments that rule there.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We’re heading for the main gate of the office site to steer the riots away from the building, but before that we need riot police equipment, Viper will drive the AFV for pure intimidation; the only thing that could pierce the vehicles armor plates is an AP .338 Lapua Magnum round shot at a clean 90 degree angle into them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Miller, Harris and I are on the front with shields and non-lethal firearms along with other allies, as of now there is over 150 other soldiers from our Company on the way to serve as riot police here; this mission will not be forgotten for years.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1830 hours, the Company is heading outside of the complex with more gear and a couple more AFVs; they’re slowly opening the gate to the streets, we’re set up around the gate to block the incoming crowd.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m blinded by the sun as the gate comes down and almost instantly I feel the push of the riot, we’re pushing in at the crowd and Viper is steering the first AFV after the first dose of carvedilol, the crowd backs out and spreads across the streets; we push away any remaining obstacles and block the only opening in the fence around the very office site we’ve just stopped the attack on, we deploy barriers to stop them from coming in and we leave people in there to protect it while we get the crowd as far from here as possible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We’re coming in pushing against around 20 people but for some reason they back out and do weird turns, we’ve at last reached a dead end but it’s filled with people, armed people; what we’ve reached is probably a bunch of the less important members of the Myriad Network.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Company spread out into alleyways and Chimera has gone into the AFV that Viper is driving, we would like to flee but we can’t risk losing so many people; Miller is mounting the .50 BMG while the rest of us pull out our personal weapons, I’ve got the 2011 pistol and an FAL, Harris has a long-barreled AR-10 and Viper has a cute CQB Honey Badger chambered in .300 BLK.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Miller screams out to get out and cover him while he’s taking the MG, we run out and Harris takes down half a dozen with his years of shooting experience; I go into the alleys to guide the rest of the company into the other AFVs while being covered by a .338 rifle and .50 BMG to top it all out.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Viper takes his beta-blockers and opens his window to mag dump whoever sticks out of cover; I got one of the squads into the AFV behind us and told them to get the rest while we cover them, I get into CQB range to finish the terrorists behind cover but the singular click of the firing pin hitting air fills me with dread as I pull out the 2011.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shot over 4 people in that very moment because they couldn’t risk getting out of their cover to hide from me, one of them survived because he didn’t lose the body armor while resting; a couple broken ribs at best, but he’s a POW until we figure out who leads the Myriad Network, at least in Syria.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The street is dead silent as we go back into our AFV to report our status to TOC, we’re heading back to the office.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Viper stops on the way there so we can interrogate the terrorist, Miller starts out with shouting and punches but at last he gives up; as we try good cop & bad cop Viper stands up and knocks him out cold, blindfolds him and starts driving towards the rest of the company to let Clark lead the interrogation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We hand him to Clark and wait some time just to hear more and more screams, as the guy leaves he doesn’t seem to have any emotion left in his helpless eyes and there is only tears going down while he stares into the distant buildings; that man is one hell of a monster when he needs to be one, that’s what you earn by leading Astrals for years.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clark told us there is somebody waiting for us in a warehouse far away and he sent us there in a small pick-up truck, not as armored as the AFV but fast and mobile; the warehouse is over 20 miles away from the office site.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m gonna write down incoming events in a simple yet descriptive format to make this easier to read.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We’re 2 miles in, nothing interesting coming up on the road.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like 15 miles left, besides occasional people passing by us there is nothing to mention.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A little over 12 miles left, we’ve spotted a bunch of locals having a fight, probably drunk or something.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perfectly 10 miles in, there were a lot of abandoned hotels in the ghost town we just passed through, maybe an abandoned tourist spot?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lucky number, just 7 miles left until we’re there, we’re stopping by a gas station to take a piss and get some food better than our MREs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just 5 miles left and we’re focusing on speeding our pace up, there is nothing in our way to the warehouse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A single mile left and we’re taking our last break before getting there.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We’re almost there, I can see the warehouses surrounding our destination, no buildings in sight and I’m sure this place isn’t even on the maps; it’s not like I can use the internet because the whole country is blurred out in almost every map service available publicly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Time to park, Viper takes a pill or two and gets his bag, he slowly and painfully heads to the barrier booth for 100 yards saying he was sent here by our platoon leader; as the gate opens Harris contacts Clark to tell him we’re there.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man comes out of the booth and tells us to follow him, which we do, he leads us into a dark warehouse; he flips a couple switches and suddenly we see it, an exoskeleton with functions that allow the user to use his legs without getting tired and perhaps even faster than before, and arms that allow the user to move them extremely fast with stunning force.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think we all know who this was meant for, they bring out a motorcycle and tell Viper to race it on foot; he slowly sneaks onto the exoskeleton and as the system automatically fits it onto the body of Viper he starts feeling immense pain with no reaction from the man that gave him the suit, which goes away after the system corrected a past mistake of being too tight for the user to comfortably use it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The moment it’s perfectly fit, Viper jumps in the direction of the motorcycle and decides that he is ready; the race begins as the man drives the motorcycle at full speed through the second warehouse building neighboring the one we were just in, Viper gives the bike a head start but even that doesn’t let it get the win.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though the suit is a paradise for Viper, he can’t use it too often because it lowers the use of muscles which is vital for his recovery.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The man taught Viper how to pack the suit to transport it, we strap it onto our truck and head to our transport ship to get back to Georgia, I’m gonna skip writing about the journey back, as it only consisted of Viper talking about the suit and how it feels.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We’ve reached the office and a couple of local workers help us move it from the car to our ship, Clark asks Viper if it was fine but I guess Viper was still too happy to notice Clark was talking to him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We’re heading back to our base, thank god the ship is faster than any plane here on earth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Viper and Miller are discussing the use of the suit on future operations, Viper has to take his carvedilol pills once again; that’s a lot of medication for one day, but at least he’s not losing his mind to shell shock.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Behind us there are 3 other transport ships with other squads, the mission was a huge success and there were close to no wounded people; at last we’re getting close to the base.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ship is landing; Hitchhiker signing out, long live our UEA.</p>
