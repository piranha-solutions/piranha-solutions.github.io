        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be, or not to be is a question I’ve yet to answer, maybe because it’s not really possible to give a sane answer while out on a battlefield, fighting for a cause; considering if it was all worth it for me to stand up and take care of what makes this country a plague, a disease so unstoppable I don’t even know if I will find the meaning of my life until I can prevent it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A country so corrupted even the head of state doesn’t get a break from their thoughts to shut it down, and I honestly think that would have a way better outcome unlike this horror-filled barren landscape that I am currently trapped in; no way in, or out for the people who didn’t know any better than I did when I signed up for this.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now look at me! Instead of helping these poor souls, I sit in a cozy trench writing in my goddamn journal, if you can even call it that; perhaps a notebook inherited from someone that meant the entire world to me is not a good place for my lamentations. But does it matter? In a few hours, none of this will, if the battle leads to a situation that no one can divert from, the omega, the end of our homeland as we know it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Morally I’ve never been straight-forward, I needed context, emotions and meaning to truly fuel the tears of sadness, desperate to roll down a steep hill, but too weak to realize that no amount of them will change the outcome as much as violence can; Generally, I never say this, but I’ve never had the opportunity to confess what I felt deep inside my heart towards all of the people I’ve lost along these front lines. People can’t perceive the true feeling of a soldier failing to overcome their rage, we’ve been through absolute hell, and yet I still think this is the worst battle I’ve fought up until this day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And you know what? Most of this pain lives in my empty head, I don’t think this battle even hurt me until now, but I know how it feels to lose everything, like your opus magnum called “life”, that you gave up on, for a dream that finally the world will be free from the sickness that is war; yet that doesn’t change anything, there is always a cause and an effect.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every new Country will be a child of War. There is no place left unclaimed, no land for the truly free, freedom is always written in the past tense; and so is peace.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I want to flee, believing I have a chance to escape the terror, there is nothing left for me to do except that. If I finally figure out the one single dilemma that troubled me for the past years and wh—</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wait, where is everybody? Where the hell is everyone, did somebody call retreat? What happened?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “TOC, do you copy?” I’ve called on my radio, but no one answered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh dear mother of god, if this book survives I beg you to spread my words because I don’t have a single chance of coming home now that the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse have come down. Farewell.</p>
